# Processing code for "Radiative absorption enhancements by black carbon controlled by particle-to-particle heterogeneity in composition"

Description: This repository contains the processing script used in the analysis presented in Fierce et al., 2020. The particle-resolved simulations can be run with PartMC version 2.1.5, which is available at http://lagrange.mechse.illinois.edu/partmc/. The repository also contains laboratory measurements from the 4th Boston College (BC4) Experiment and field observations from Fontana, CA (Cappa et al., JGR 2019).

Accompanying paper: Fierce, L., Y. Li, N. Riemer, N. A. J. Schutgens, A. Aiken, M. K. Dubey, P.-L. Ma, and D. Wuebbles, Constraining black carbon aging in global models to reflect timescales for internal mixing (in progress)
